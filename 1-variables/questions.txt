q1. Declare a variable to represent temperature in Celsius.
Convert this temperature to Fahrenheit using the formula

Use fmt.Printf instead of Println
// fmt.Printf verbs could be found on top of fmt documentation // https://pkg.go.dev/fmt#hdr-Printing
Use type casting in Go


	log.New(os.Stdout)
	l.Println("hello")

q2. Create a program to store and print a person's and their project's details. Declare and initialize variables for the following details,
    Project name (string)
    Code lines written (uint8)
    Bugs found (int)
    Is the project complete? (bool)
    Average lines of code written per hour (float64)
    Team lead name (string)
    Project deadline in days (int)
    Additionally, demonstrate a uint overflow by initializing the largest possible value for uint and then adding 1 to it


q3. Use log.New() and print a log message
    use shortfile flag and stdFlags for flag argument (bit of Google required)
// Hint:- first value to this function could be os.Stdout
// Printing: l.Println("hello this is first log message")
